# Soil-moisture-measurement-system-with-STM32F429I-Discovery-and-Open429Z-D.
We have implemented an embedded system for monitoring soil moisture using an <b>STM32</b> microcontroller. The system code reads an analog signal from a soil moisture sensor, interprets its value to determine the soil moisture level, and sends the results via <b>UART</b> to a terminal application (in our case, <b>Tera Term</b>). A digital <b>GPIO</b> pin is also monitored to provide a binary indication of soil conditions.

## Software tools used:
* Programming Language: C
* STM32CubeMX
* Keil uVision5
* Tera Term

## Hardware components used:
* STM32F429I Discovery + Open429Z-D development kit
* soil moisture sensor
* PCB circuit with comparator/converter
* six female-female connection wires
* USB power cable with circular plug
* two USB A â€“ USB mini B cables
